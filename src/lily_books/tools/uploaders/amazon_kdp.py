"""Amazon KDP upload integration - LEGACY/BACKUP IMPLEMENTATION.

‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATED: PublishDrive is now the recommended distribution platform.
    This integration is maintained as a backup option for direct Amazon access.

STUB IMPLEMENTATION: Documents the upload process for Amazon KDP.

For production use, implement either:
1. Selenium WebDriver automation (fragile, requires maintenance)
2. Manual upload following documented steps
3. Third-party service (Publisher Rocket, etc.)

Amazon does not provide an official public API for KDP uploads.
