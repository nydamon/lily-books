## Usage Patterns

### Proactive Invocation
Agents are **automatically invoked** by Claude when their expertise is needed. You don't need to manually invoke them unless you want to.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
For complex tasks, Claude may invoke multiple agents simultaneously:

**Example**: Adding a new publishing validation step
- Invokes `/langgraph-pipeline` to understand graph structure
- Invokes `/publishing` to understand validation requirements
- Combines knowledge to provide comprehensive solution

---

## Agent Structure

Each agent contains:

1. **Purpose Statement**: High-level role and expertise
2. **Key Knowledge Areas**: Specific domains of expertise
3. **Key Files**: Relevant source files with line numbers
4. **Common Questions**: Frequently asked questions and solutions
5. **Best Practices**: Recommended patterns and approaches
6. **Related Agents**: Cross-references to complementary agents

## Development

### Creating New Agents
See [AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](../../docs/agents/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)

### Testing Agents
See [AGENT_TESTING.md](../../docs/agents/AGENT_TESTING.md)

## Maintenance

Agents should be updated when:
- New features are added to the codebase
- File structures change significantly
- Common questions evolve
- Best practices are updated
