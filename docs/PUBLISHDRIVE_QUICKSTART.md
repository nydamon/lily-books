## Distribution Timelines

After successful upload:

| Retailer | Time to Live |
|----------|--------------|
| Amazon KDP | 24-72 hours |
| Google Play Books | 3-5 days |
| Kobo | 1-3 days |
| Barnes & Noble | 5-10 days |
| Apple Books | 7-14 days |
| Other retailers | 1-4 weeks |

## What You'll Receive

After distribution completes:

‚úÖ **Free ISBN from PublishDrive**
‚úÖ **Universal book link** (works on all stores)
‚úÖ **Access to unified sales dashboard**
‚úÖ **Monthly sales reports**
‚úÖ **Direct royalty payments** (monthly or quarterly)

---

## Royalty Rates

PublishDrive takes a **10% commission** on gross royalties from retailers.

### Example Calculation:

If your book sells for $2.99 on Amazon:
- Amazon pays: $2.09 (70% royalty at $2.99 price point)
- PublishDrive fee: $0.21 (10% of $2.09)
- **Your net earnings**: $1.88

This is comparable to using Amazon directly while gaining distribution to 400+ additional stores.

**A**: Yes! Update price in PublishDrive dashboard and changes sync to all retailers within 24-48 hours.
